	abstract = {Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) provide a report-free and continuous measure of neural processing. Recent progress in display technology has allowed for the tagging of multiple stimuli simultaneously at \&gt;60Hz frequencies - high enough to evade perceptibility, while still evoking an oscillatory neural response. Known as Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT), this technique has currently only been used in combination with Magnetoencephalography (MEG), which is less accessible compared to Electroencephalography (EEG). Although responses to LEDs flickering at similar frequencies have been shown in EEG, it is currently unclear whether RIFT, using a more conventional stimulus display, can sufficiently evoke a response in EEG, and therefore whether it is worth adding the RIFT-EEG pairing to the cognitive neuroscientist{\textquoteright}s toolkit. Here, we successfully implement the first RIFT-EEG setup. We show that the oscillatory input is measurable in the EEG trace, what its topographical spread is, a rough range of applicable frequencies, and that this response is comparable to that evoked in MEG.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = { Background: The study of genetic variant carriers provides an opportunity to identify neurophysiological changes in preclinical stages. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a low-cost and minimally invasive technique which, together with machine learning, provide the possibility to construct systems that classify subjects that might develop Alzheimer’s disease (AD).Objective: The aim of this paper is to evaluate the capacity of the machine learning techniques to classify healthy Non-Carriers (NonCr) from Asymptomatic Carriers (ACr) of PSEN1-E280A variant for autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease (ADAD), using spectral features from EEG channels and brain-related independent components (ICs) obtained using independent component analysis (ICA).Methods: EEG was recorded in 27 ACr and 33 NonCr. Statistical significance analysis was applied to spectral information from channels and group ICA (gICA), standardized low-resolution tomography (sLORETA) analysis was applied over the IC as well. Strategies for feature selection and classification like Chi-square, mutual informationm and support vector machines (SVM) were evaluated over the dataset.Results: A test accuracy up to 83\% was obtained by implementing a SVM with spectral features derived from gICA. The main findings are related to theta and beta rhythms, generated in the parietal and occipital regions, like the precuneus and superior parietal lobule.Conclusion: Promising models for classification of preclinical AD due to PSEN-1-E280A variant can be trained using spectral features, and the importance of the beta band and precuneus region is highlighted in asymptomatic stages, opening up the possibility of its use as a screening methodology. }

	abstract = {The recent introduction of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) monitors with refresh rates of 240 Hz or more opens new possibilities for their use as precise stimulation devices in vision research, experimental psychology, and electrophysiology. These affordable high-speed monitors, targeted at video gamers, promise several advantages over the cathode ray tube (CRT) and liquid crystal display (LCD) monitors commonly used in these fields. Unlike LCDs, OLED displays have self-emitting pixels that can show true black, resulting in superior contrast ratios, a broad color gamut, and good viewing angles. More importantly, the latest gaming OLEDs promise excellent timing properties with minimal input lags and rapid transition times. However, OLED technology also has potential drawbacks, notably Auto-Brightness Limiting (ABL) behavior, where the local luminance of a stimulus can change with the number of currently illuminated pixels. This study characterized a 240 Hz OLED monitor, the ASUS PG27AQDM, in terms of its timing properties, spatial uniformity, viewing angles, warm-up times, and ABL behavior. We also compared its responses to those of CRTs and LCDs. Results confirm the monitor{\textquoteright}s excellent temporal properties with CRT-like transition times (around 0.3 ms), wide viewing angles, and decent spatial uniformity. Additionally, we found that ABL could be prevented with appropriate settings. We illustrate the monitor{\textquoteright}s benefits in two time-critical paradigms: Rapid {\textquotedblleft}invisible{\textquotedblright} flicker stimulation and the gaze-contingent presentation of stimuli during eye movements. Ourfindings suggest that the newest gaming OLEDs are precise and cost-effective stimulation devices for visual experiments that have several key advantages over CRTs and LCDs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
